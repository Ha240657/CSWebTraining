    <h2>Module 3: Device and Network Safety</h2>

    <h3>What is Device and Network Safety?</h3>
    <p>Device security is the practice of safeguarding devices connected to the internet, e.g. phones, PCs, tablets, etc.</p>
    <p>While network security is the protection of the underlying network infrastructure.</p>
    <p>These are done to defend against cyber threats and unauthorized access, as well as protection against misuse and theft.</p>

    <h3>Benefits of Device and Network Security</h3>
    <p>By safeguarding your devices, it helps protect your devices from threats such as malware, phishing, data breaches as well as theft.</p>

    <h3>How to Keep Devices Secure</h3>
    <p>To safeguard your devices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure to lock your screens.</li>
      <li>Use encryption as well as security apps.</li>
      <li>Regularly update your device's OS to the latest version.</li>
      <li>In case the device gets lost, make sure you can remotely wipe any data to protect your personal information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Keep Networks Secure</h3>
    <p>By having good network security, risks such as cyberthreats and attacks are mitigated, helping protect personal or confidential data by blocking unauthorized access to the network.</p>
    <p>To keep your network secure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a firewall to monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic.</li>
