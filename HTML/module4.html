    <h3><b>Types of Social Engineering</b></h3>

    <h4>Phishing</h4>
    <p>
      Phishing uses deceptive emails, calls, texts, or social media messages to trick people into revealing sensitive info or downloading malware. It ranges from broad, generic emails to highly targeted attacks on specific individuals or executives. Variations include voice phishing (vishing), SMS phishing (smishing), and fake social media accounts (angler phishing). Phishing is a leading cause of malware infections and costly data breaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attackers tempt victims with appealing offers—like free downloads or USB drives left in public—to steal data or infect devices with malware.
    </p>

    <h4>Tailgating</h4>
    <p>
      An unauthorized person follows an authorized person into secure physical or digital spaces, such as sneaking through a door or using an unattended logged-in computer.
    </p>

    <h4>Pretexting</h4>
    <p>
      Attackers create a fake scenario to gain trust and convince victims to share confidential information or grant device access, often by claiming there’s been a security issue.
    </p>

    <h4>Quid Pro Quo</h4>
    <p>
      Scammers offer something desirable—like contest prizes or loyalty rewards—in exchange for sensitive information.
    </p>

    <h4>Scareware</h4>
    <p>
      Fake warnings or alerts frighten users into sharing personal info or downloading malware, often posing as law enforcement or tech support.
    </p>

    <h4>Watering Hole Attack</h4>
    <p>
      Attackers infect legitimate websites visited by their targets, enabling malware infection or data theft when the victim accesses the site.

    <h3><b>Defenses Against Social Engineering</b></h3>

    <h4>Security Awareness Training</h4>
    <p>
      Educating users helps them spot scams and understand how even small pieces of personal information can be exploited.
    </p>

    <h4>Access Controls</h4>
    <p>
      Multifactor authentication and zero trust policies limit unauthorized access, even if credentials are compromised.
    </p>

    <h4>Cybersecurity Tools</h4>
    <p>
      Spam filters, firewalls, antivirus, and advanced detection solutions help prevent, detect, and respond to social engineering attacks.
    </p>

    <h4>Regular Software Updates</h4>
    <p>
      Keeping systems patched closes vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.
