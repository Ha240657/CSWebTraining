    <h2>Module 1: Password Security</h2>

    <p>Learn how to create and manage strong passwords to prevent unauthorised access to your accounts.</p>

    <h3>What is Password Security?</h3>
    <p>Password security is the practice of making strong and complex passwords to protect personal and confidential information from cyber-attacks. It is crucial in cybersecurity to prevent unauthorized access, identity theft and data breaches.</p>  

    <h3>How to Create a Strong Password</h3>
    <p>To make a strong password it is crucial to have a password mixed with symbols, numbers and letters which are lower case and upper case to avoid predictable patterns. You can also use password managers to store and generate your password for your many accounts.</p>  

    <h3>What You Should Avoid When Creating Passwords</h3> 
    <p>When creating a password, it is recommended that you do not contain any content that can be easily guessed, such as names, birthdays, and common words. It is also recommended that all your accounts have different passwords so that if one account is ever hacked, the others will be safe for the time being. Also, avoid sharing passwords with others. By avoiding these mistakes, your account and data will be protected from possible threats and attacks.</p>  

    <h3>Example: How Password Strength Works</h3>
    <p>Take the password “johnsmith”. It is very weak, and it is easy to gain access to any account with that password.</p>

    <h4>Weak Password</h4>
    <p>By using a password strength test, the password will take 2 minutes to crack.</p>

    <h4>Improving Strength with Case Variation</h4>
    <p>By mixing lower and uppercases we get “JoHnSmITh”. It is stronger than the password with it all being either upper or lower case. Taking 19 hours to crack.</p>

    <h4>Adding Numbers and Symbols</h4>
    <p>By adding numbers and symbols the password would take much longer to crack. For example, “J@Hn5m1Th” would take around 400 years to be cracked.</p>
