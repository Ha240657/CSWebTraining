   <h2>Module 5: Secure Remote Work</h2>
        <p>Get tips for staying secure while working from home or on the go, including VPN usage and device encryption.</p>
    <h1>Remote Working Overview</h1>
  <p>Remote working means working partly or fully away from your organisation’s main sites in the UK. Hybrid working is now common across government and other organisations. However, remote work brings different security risks compared to working in the office, and these must be carefully managed.</p>

  <h2>Technology and Responsibility</h2>
  <p>Government technology allows users to work remotely at both OFFICIAL and SECRET levels. But remote working means users must understand the risks to the information they handle and act with good security judgment.</p>

  <h2>Risks of Remote Working</h2>
  <p>Working outside secure government offices increases risks such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>People overhearing or seeing classified information (this includes family, friends, or anyone nearby).</li>
    <li>Equipment or information being tampered with if left unattended.</li>
    <li>Being targeted by attackers physically or digitally.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Users must ensure appropriate security measures protect the information they access remotely.</p>

  <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>Everyone working for the Government must protect information and assets regardless of where they work. When working remotely, security should be at least as good as in the office, if not better. Key points:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assess risks in your remote working environment (e.g., others seeing your screen or physical documents).</li>
    <li>Use corporate IT to access classified information; avoid taking physical documents out unless absolutely necessary and approved.</li>
    <li>Don’t draw attention to handling government information remotely.</li>
    <li>Complete required training on approved remote working technology.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Contractors and Facility Security Clearance</h2>
  <p>Contractors working at SECRET level outside government facilities must follow specific clearance rules, with security approval managed by the contracting authority.</p>

  <h2>Remote Working Controls</h2>
  <p>Users should follow their organisation’s policies on remote working. There are three common remote working scenarios: home, flexible, and international working. Controls depend on the sensitivity of the information, risk of compromise, and need-to-know principle.</p>

  <h3>Home Remote Working</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Defined as working from your registered home address.</li>
    <li>Users must understand and manage security risks at home, which vary depending on household members or visitors.</li>
    <li>Follow baseline security guidance for OFFICIAL and SECRET information.</li>
    <li>Don’t allow anyone without clearance and need-to-know access to classified information.</li>
    <li>Consult security teams if contractors do renovations where SECRET info is handled.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Flexible Remote Working</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Working from locations other than office or home (e.g., hotels, shared workspaces).</li>
    <li>These places may have higher security risks due to unfamiliarity and accessibility.</li>
    <li>Local policies should specify approvals needed to take classified information to such places.</li>
    <li>Don’t take classified information abroad without approval from line manager, HR, and security.</li>
    <li>Follow security behaviours and baseline guidance for OFFICIAL and SECRET work.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>International Remote Working</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Working outside the UK, away from UK government missions.</li>
    <li>Must have approvals following local HR and security policies.</li>
    <li>Security advisors will advise on controls needed based on the location’s risks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Reporting Security Incidents</h2>
  <p>Any suspected or actual security incidents (loss, tampering, compromise) must be reported immediately to your security team, following organisational rules.</p>
