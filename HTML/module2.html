    <h2>Module 2: Phishing Awareness</h2>
     <p>Understand how phishing attacks work and how to spot suspicious emails and messages.</p>
  <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
  <p>Phishing is an online fraud attempt by hackers to get your private information such as passwords, credit/debit cards, or bank account data. Phishing attempts are usually conducted by sending false emails or messages which appear to be from trusted sources like banks or well-known websites.</p>

  <h2>What are Phishing Attacks?</h2>
  <p>Phishing is a form of cyber-attack where the user or victim is duped in an unethical way to click on harmful sites which are crafted in such a way that the victim believes it to be authentic, thus falling prey to it. The most common way phishing happens is usually via spam emails that appear authentic and thus, taking away all credentials from the victim. The attacker aims to gain confidential information such as passwords, credit card details, social security numbers, and date of birth. The information stolen is then used to further target the user by impersonating them causing data theft.</p>

  <h2>How is Phishing conducted?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Clicking on an unknown file or attachments sent in emails</li>
    <li>Using open or free wifi hotspots</li>
    <li>Responding to social media requests</li>
    <li>Clicking on unauthenticated links or ads</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Types of Phishing Attacks</h2>

  <h3>Email phishing</h3>
  <p>The classic phishing attack using fraudulent emails to trick victims into giving sensitive data.</p>

  <h3>Spear phishing</h3>
  <p>The attacker first gathers detailed information about the target and then sends highly targeted malicious emails designed to trick the victim into sharing confidential data.</p>

  <h3>Whaling</h3>
  <p>Targets high-profile individuals like CEOs or CFOs with emails that appear urgent or pressurizing, similar to spear phishing but aimed at executives or companies.</p>

  <h3>Smishing</h3>
  <p>Phishing conducted via SMS, where victims receive texts containing links to fake websites or are asked to call numbers or email addresses to share personal information.</p>

  <h3>Vishing</h3>
  <p>Voice phishing involving phone calls where attackers use caller ID spoofing to impersonate trusted sources and extract sensitive info.</p>

  <h3>Clone phishing</h3>
  <p>Attackers copy legitimate emails from trusted sources but replace attachments or links with malicious ones, sending these to many victims to spread malware or steal data.</p>

  <h2>Impact of Phishing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Financial loss</li>
    <li>Identity theft</li>
    <li>Damage to reputation</li>
    <li>Disruption to business operations</li>
    <li>Spread of malware</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Signs of Phishing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Suspicious email addresses</li>
    <li>Urgent requests for personal information</li>
    <li>Poor grammar and spelling</li>
    <li>Requests for sensitive information</li>
    <li>Unusual links or attachments</li>
    <li>Strange URLs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Protection against Phishing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Download software from authorized sources only where you have trust</li>
    <li>Never share your private details with unknown links and keep your data safe from hackers</li>
    <li>Check URLs carefully</li>
    <li>Avoid replying to suspicious emails</li>
    <li>Use phishing detection tools</li>
    <li>Avoid free wifi</li>
    <li>Keep systems updated</li>
    <li>Keep firewall systems ON</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fake websites vs Real Websites</h2>
  <p>Check the URL of the website – HTTPS means it’s secure, while HTTP means it might not be safe. Avoid sites with HTTP in the URL. Check the domain name carefully — attackers often mimic large brands but with misspellings or slight changes.</p>
  <p>Look at the site design — attackers try to imitate the real site but may miss details; if something looks off, it might be fake. Check for available pages — fake websites often only have a login page and lack other pages that the legitimate site has. If you only see limited pages, be cautious.</p>
