    <h2>Module 2: Phishing Awareness</h2>
    <p>Understand how phishing attacks work and how to spot suspicious emails and messages.</p>
     
    <h3>What is Phishing?</h3>
    <p>Phishing is an online fraud attempt by hackers to get your private information such as passwords, credit/debit cards, or bank account data. Phishing attempts are usually conducted by sending false emails or messages which appear to be from trusted sources like banks or well-known websites.</p>

    <h3>What are Phishing Attacks?</h3>
    <p>Phishing is a form of cyber-attack where the user or victim is duped in an unethical way to click on harmful sites crafted to appear authentic. The attacker aims to gain confidential information such as passwords, credit card details, or social security numbers, often used for further attacks or identity theft.</p>

    <h3>How is Phishing Conducted?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Clicking on unknown files or attachments in emails</li>
      <li>Using open or free Wi-Fi hotspots</li>
      <li>Responding to unsolicited social media requests</li>
      <li>Clicking on unauthenticated links or ads</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Whaling</h4>
    <p>Targets high-level executives with emails that appear urgent or from trusted authorities.</p>

    <h4>Smishing</h4>
    <p>Phishing via SMS messages, often containing malicious links or fraudulent contact details.</p>

    <h4>Vishing</h4>
    <p>Voice phishing using spoofed caller ID and social engineering to extract sensitive info.</p>

    <h4>Clone Phishing</h4>
    <p>Copies of legitimate emails are sent with altered links or attachments to spread malware or steal data.</p>

    <h3>Impact of Phishing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Financial loss</li>
      <li>Identity theft</li>
      <li>Damage to reputation</li>
      <li>Disruption to business operations</li>
      <li>Spread of malware</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Signs of Phishing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Suspicious email addresses</li>
      <li>Urgent requests for personal information</li>
      <li>Poor grammar and spelling</li>
      <li>Requests for sensitive information</li>
      <li>Unusual links or attachments</li>
      <li>Strange or misspelled URLs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Protection Against Phishing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Only download software from authorised sources</li>
      <li>Never share private details via suspicious links or platforms</li>
      <li>Double-check URLs before clicking</li>
      <li>Avoid responding to unexpected emails</li>
      <li>Use phishing detection tools</li>
      <li>Avoid public Wi-Fi when accessing sensitive data</li>
      <li>Keep software and systems up to date</li>
      <li>Keep firewall and antivirus tools active</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fake Websites vs Real Websites</h3>
    <p>Always check the URL â€” HTTPS indicates a secure connection. Look closely at the domain name to catch misspellings or impostor domains. Real websites tend to have more than just a login page. If a site looks overly simplistic or unfinished, be cautious.</p>
